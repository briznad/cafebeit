## brief explanation of the file & format
The [data.json](https://github.com/briznad/cafebeit/blob/gh-pages/data/data.json) file is used to store the data that shows up on the website. Any changes saved to this file will show up on the website in a short ammount of time (a couple minutes max). The file is formatted according to the [JSON](http://www.json.org/) standard (if you check out the previous link you'll see a bunch of technical jargon and confusing graphs, so I'd advise against it). The short explanation is that JSON is a way to format information so that it's decently easy for a human to read while still being structured enough for a computer to make sense of. By doing little things, like putting all text inside double quotes (`"`) and lists of information inside brackets (`[â€¦]`), we can bridge that comminucation gap between man and machine. Holy shit, that's rad! **The takeaway is** that a bit of caution should be exercised when manually updating JSON, since small mistakes, like forgetting to add a closing double quote at the end of a sentence, can break the website. Luckily we're using GitHub to back up our data, so even if something goes wrong it is backed up, bust still.
## sections of the data file
- `"name"`
This is a string with the name of the cafe. This should never change from "Cafe Beit" unless you rename the cafe.
- `"photo"`
This is an object with 2 possible members:
 - `"file"`
This is the filename of the main image. The file referenced here must exist within the [images](https://github.com/briznad/cafebeit/tree/gh-pages/assets/images) folder.
 - `"attribution"` [optional]
This is an object that allows you to give the photographer credit for the photo. It consists of a name which will optionally link to either a url or email. If both are present the url takes precedence.
- `"description"` [optional]
This is a list of paragraphs. It's important that each paragraph be entered within enclosing double quotes and separated by a comma:
```
"description" : [
	"Paragraph 1. Very Interesting!",
	"Paragraph 2. A must-read!",
	"Paragraph 3. Oh god! Is there anything else on my kindle?!"
]
```
